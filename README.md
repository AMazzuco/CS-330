## How do I approach designing software?
I learned a lot while working on this project. I have previously used 3D modeling programs to create scenes but with this project I learned how to use OpenGL to achieve the same goals without the use of 3D modeling programs. This project helped me learn more varied ways to work with 3D scenes.

## How do I approach developing programs?
While working on my 3d scene I tried to approach it by making the most complex shapes objects first. Throughout this project the iteration between weeks of working on the same project but adding in new functionality was very helpful. This was helpful in keeping the project more managable and kept me on track. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I am a big fan of 3D modeling and wanted to get back into 3D animation at some point in the future. This helped me have a greater understanding and appreciation for all of the math that 3D modeling programs do behind the scenes as it was fairly challenging.
